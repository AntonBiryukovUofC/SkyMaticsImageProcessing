# SkyMaticsImageProcessing
The repo for my work with Skymatics.

October 1, Sat: Tile the large (1 GB+) tiff images into smaller images using VIPS library and its scripts.
As an alternative, GDAL library seems to be a good candidate, as it 's done specifically for georeferenced TIFFs.

October : Mastered tiling using gdal2tiles.py, the instructions to follow soon.
Added the unsupervised clustering of images based on the histogram, fractal dimensions and Gabor-filtered images.

Nov 5:
We need to start a Google Drive account / Dropbox account so we could also store the images for each classifier, without rebuilding them all the time.
With the next commit I will add the comments into each file and explain what the file purpose is.

Stay tuned!
